# Advent of Code Solutions Rust

This will most probably just be a solution here and there that I solve using Rust. I am totally newbie in Rust and just want to use AoC to learn to code using Rust.

The project is setup using `cargo new aoc`, but I already had the folder, so I used `cargo init`.

## Development

Build the Rust project using `cargo build` and run the Rust solution using `cargo run`.

To run tests, run `cargo test`.
